# HTML

## HTML

- Structure of your website
- elements -> what the browser reads and displays to the user
  - tags
    - name
    - opening
    - closing (most times)
  - content
- general structure
  - html -> contains all other elements
  - head -> information that the user will NOT see on the webpage
  - body -> information/elements that will be displayed to the user
  - title -> inside the head and displays in the browser's tab

- formatting "rules"
  - HTML files should be named in lowercase and separated by hyphens
  - convert tabs to spaces
  - avoid leaving trailing spaces
  - elements inside of other elements should be indented one time (2 spaces)

- semantic elements -> named based on what is inside of them
  - header -> top of the body and contains logos, introductory content, navigation
  - main -> between the header and footer -> main content (articles, information, products, etc.)
  - footer -> bottom of the body and contains contact info, special links, back to top link
  - h1-h6 -> header 1 (title of website) (largest)  - header 6 (smallest)
  - nav -> navigation - nav bars
  - a -> hyperlink (anchor tag)
  - section/articles -> grouping of content
  - img -> shows an image
  - ol/ul -> ordered list (numbered) / unordered list (bullet points)
    - li -> list item
  - p - paragraphs

- non-semantic elements
  - div -> divider
  - span

- advantages of semantic HTML
  - Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
  - Screen Readers
  - Working with humans

- attributes - give additional info for the element

- comments
  - do not display in the browser
  - used to be used before semantic HTML
  - should explain WHY the code is there, not WHAT it's doing

- troubleshooting and debugging
  - ALWAYS write and test your code as you go!!!
  - are you missing a closing tag?
  - are there spelling errors?
  - comment out certain parts of code to find the broken code

Chrome Dev Tools - function F12 -> elements
  or right click on your page -> inspect
